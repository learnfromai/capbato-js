Core Functionality:
WHEN a client sends GET request to /api/doctors 
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with a JSON array containing all doctors with their ID, first name, last name, specialization, and contact number

WHEN a client sends GET request to /api/doctors and doctors exist in the database
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with JSON array where each doctor object contains DoctorID, FirstName, LastName, Specialization, and ContactNumber fields

WHEN a client sends GET request to /api/doctors and no doctors exist in the database
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with an empty JSON array

---

Response Format:
WHEN the system returns doctor data successfully
THE SYSTEM SHALL format each doctor object with integer DoctorID, string FirstName, string LastName, string Specialization, and string ContactNumber

WHEN the system returns doctor data
THE SYSTEM SHALL ensure all string fields are properly encoded and safe for JSON transmission

---

Error Handling:
WHEN a client sends GET request to /api/doctors and a database connection error occurs
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 500 with JSON error object containing error message "Database error"

WHEN a client sends GET request to /api/doctors and a database query error occurs  
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 500 with JSON error object containing error message "Database error"

WHEN database errors occur during doctor retrieval
THE SYSTEM SHALL log the specific error details to the console for debugging purposes

---

Request Validation:
WHEN a client sends GET request to /api/doctors with unsupported HTTP method
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed

WHEN a client sends GET request to /api/doctors with invalid Accept header requesting non-JSON format
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 406 Not Acceptable or default to JSON response

---

Security Requirements:
THE SYSTEM SHALL ensure doctor contact information is only accessible through proper API endpoints
THE SYSTEM SHALL not expose sensitive database connection details in error responses
THE SYSTEM SHALL log all doctor data access requests for audit purposes

---

Performance Requirements:
THE SYSTEM SHALL execute doctor retrieval queries efficiently using appropriate database indexing
THE SYSTEM SHALL handle concurrent requests to /api/doctors without data corruption
THE SYSTEM SHALL respond to doctor list requests within reasonable time limits to maintain system responsiveness
