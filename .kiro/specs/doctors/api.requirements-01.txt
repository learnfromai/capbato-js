Core Functionality:
WHEN a client sends GET request to /doctors 
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with JSON array containing all doctors with their complete information

WHEN a client requests all doctors 
THE SYSTEM SHALL retrieve doctors from database including DoctorID, FirstName, LastName, Specialization, and ContactNumber fields

WHEN doctors exist in the database 
THE SYSTEM SHALL return each doctor as JSON object with id, first_name, last_name, specialization, and phone properties

---

Response Format:
WHEN a successful doctors retrieval occurs 
THE SYSTEM SHALL return Content-Type "application/json" with properly formatted JSON array

WHEN returning doctor information 
THE SYSTEM SHALL map database fields: DoctorID to id, FirstName to first_name, LastName to last_name, Specialization to specialization, ContactNumber to phone

WHEN no doctors exist in database 
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with empty JSON array

---

Error Handling:
WHEN database connection fails during doctors retrieval 
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 500 with error message "Database error"

WHEN database query fails during doctors retrieval 
THE SYSTEM SHALL log error details to console and return HTTP 500 with generic error message

WHEN an unexpected error occurs during doctors retrieval 
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 500 with error object containing error field

---

Request Validation:
WHEN a client sends non-GET request to /doctors endpoint 
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 404 with error message "Route not found"

WHEN a client sends GET request with invalid path parameters to /doctors 
THE SYSTEM SHALL handle gracefully and return appropriate error response

---

Data Integrity:
WHEN returning doctor data 
THE SYSTEM SHALL ensure all required fields (DoctorID, FirstName, LastName) are present from database

WHEN doctor has null Specialization or ContactNumber 
THE SYSTEM SHALL return these fields as null values in JSON response

WHEN doctor data contains special characters 
THE SYSTEM SHALL properly escape and return data without corruption

---

Performance Requirements:
WHEN retrieving doctors list 
THE SYSTEM SHALL execute single database query without unnecessary joins or subqueries

WHEN processing doctors data 
THE SYSTEM SHALL return response within reasonable time limits for typical dataset sizes

---

Security Requirements:
THE SYSTEM SHALL not expose sensitive internal database information in error messages
THE SYSTEM SHALL not log sensitive doctor information to console during normal operations
THE SYSTEM SHALL validate all database inputs to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities
