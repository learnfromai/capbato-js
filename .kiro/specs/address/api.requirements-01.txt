Core Address Data Retrieval:
WHEN a client sends GET request to /api/address/provinces 
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with JSON array of all Philippine provinces containing code and name properties

WHEN a client sends GET request to /api/address/cities/{provinceCode} with valid province code
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with JSON array of cities/municipalities for that province containing code and name properties

WHEN a client sends GET request to /api/address/barangays/{cityCode} with valid city code
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with JSON array of barangays for that city containing code and name properties

WHEN the system returns province data
THE SYSTEM SHALL generate province codes by converting province names to uppercase with spaces replaced by underscores

WHEN the system returns city/municipality data
THE SYSTEM SHALL generate city codes by converting city names to lowercase with spaces replaced by underscores

WHEN the system returns barangay data
THE SYSTEM SHALL generate barangay codes in format "B001", "B002", etc. based on alphabetical ordering

Request Validation:
WHEN a client sends GET request to /api/address/cities/{provinceCode} with non-existent province code
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with empty JSON array

WHEN a client sends GET request to /api/address/barangays/{cityCode} with non-existent city code  
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with empty JSON array

WHEN a client sends GET request to /api/address/cities/{provinceCode} with malformed province code
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with empty JSON array

WHEN a client sends GET request to /api/address/barangays/{cityCode} with malformed city code
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with empty JSON array

Data Processing Requirements:
WHEN the system processes address data
THE SYSTEM SHALL load Philippine address data from philippines-complete.json file

WHEN the system returns province list
THE SYSTEM SHALL sort provinces alphabetically by name

WHEN the system returns city/municipality list  
THE SYSTEM SHALL sort cities alphabetically by name

WHEN the system returns barangay list
THE SYSTEM SHALL sort barangays alphabetically by name

Error Handling:
WHEN the system fails to load Philippine address data file
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 500 with error message "Failed to fetch provinces"

WHEN the system encounters error while processing cities request
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 500 with error message "Failed to fetch cities"

WHEN the system encounters error while processing barangays request  
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 500 with error message "Failed to fetch barangays"

WHEN any address endpoint encounters an error
THE SYSTEM SHALL log the error details to console for debugging

Data Format Requirements:
THE SYSTEM SHALL return all address data in JSON format with Content-Type application/json
THE SYSTEM SHALL ensure all province objects contain "code" and "name" string properties
THE SYSTEM SHALL ensure all city/municipality objects contain "code" and "name" string properties  
THE SYSTEM SHALL ensure all barangay objects contain "code" and "name" string properties
THE SYSTEM SHALL return consistent data structure across all address endpoints
