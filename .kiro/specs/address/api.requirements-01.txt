Core Address Data Retrieval:
WHEN a client sends GET request to /address/provinces
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with JSON array containing all Philippine provinces with code and name properties

WHEN a client sends GET request to /address/cities/{provinceCode} with valid province code
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with JSON array containing all cities/municipalities for the specified province

WHEN a client sends GET request to /address/barangays/{cityCode} with valid city code  
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with JSON array containing all barangays for the specified city/municipality

---

Response Format:
WHEN the system returns province data
THE SYSTEM SHALL return each province with code property in uppercase format with underscores and name property with original province name

WHEN the system returns city data
THE SYSTEM SHALL return each city with code property in lowercase format with underscores and name property with original city name

WHEN the system returns barangay data
THE SYSTEM SHALL return each barangay with code property in B### format (B001, B002, etc.) and name property with original barangay name

WHEN the system returns any address data
THE SYSTEM SHALL sort all results alphabetically by name property

---

Request Validation:
WHEN a client sends request to /address/cities/{provinceCode} with non-existent province code
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with empty JSON array

WHEN a client sends request to /address/barangays/{cityCode} with non-existent city code
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with empty JSON array

WHEN a client sends request with malformed URL parameters
THE SYSTEM SHALL process the request using the provided parameter value and return appropriate results or empty array

---

Error Handling:
WHEN the system encounters file system errors while loading Philippine address data
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 500 with JSON error object containing message "Failed to fetch provinces"

WHEN the system encounters errors while processing cities request
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 500 with JSON error object containing message "Failed to fetch cities"

WHEN the system encounters errors while processing barangays request  
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 500 with JSON error object containing message "Failed to fetch barangays"

WHEN any server error occurs
THE SYSTEM SHALL log the error details to console for debugging purposes

---

Data Consistency:
THE SYSTEM SHALL load Philippine address data from static JSON file at system startup
THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain consistent province code generation by converting province names to uppercase with spaces replaced by underscores
THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain consistent city code generation by converting city names to lowercase with spaces replaced by underscores
THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain consistent barangay code generation using sequential B### pattern starting from B001

---

Performance Requirements:
THE SYSTEM SHALL return province data within 2 seconds under normal load conditions
THE SYSTEM SHALL return city data within 2 seconds under normal load conditions  
THE SYSTEM SHALL return barangay data within 2 seconds under normal load conditions
THE SYSTEM SHALL handle concurrent requests to address endpoints without data corruption
