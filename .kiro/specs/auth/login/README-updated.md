# Login Page Requirements Analysis

This directory contains EARS requirements documentation for the login page functionality.

## Files:

### 1. `requirements-01.txt`
Contains the **ideal/target** EARS requirements that define what the login page should implement for a complete user experience. This includes features like:
- Remember Me checkbox
- Forgot Password link  
- Create Account registration link
- Real-time email format validation
- Auto-focus on username field
- Submit button disabled states and loading indicators
- Auto-redirect for users with valid stored tokens

### 2. `current-implementation.requirements.txt` 
Contains EARS requirements that accurately describe the **current actual implementation** of the login page as it exists in `legacy/client/pages/login.html`. This documents what is currently working, including:
- Basic username/password form
- Simple authentication flow with role-based redirection
- Basic error message display
- Go Back button functionality

### 3. `test-current-implementation.html`
A test file that can be used to validate that the current implementation matches the documented current requirements.

### 4. `api.requirements-01.txt`
Backend API requirements for the authentication endpoints.

## Usage:

- Use `requirements-01.txt` for understanding the complete vision/target state
- Use `current-implementation.requirements.txt` for understanding what actually works today
- Use the test file to validate the current implementation
- Use the gap between the two requirements files to plan future development work
