Core Registration:
WHEN a client sends POST request to /auth/register with valid role, username, password, fullName, and email in JSON format 
THE SYSTEM SHALL validate all required fields, hash the password, create user account, and return HTTP 201 with success message

WHEN a client sends registration request with valid data 
THE SYSTEM SHALL hash the password using bcrypt with 10 rounds before storing in database

WHEN a client sends registration request with valid unique credentials 
THE SYSTEM SHALL insert user record into database with role, full_name, username, hashed password, and email

Request Validation:
WHEN a client sends registration request missing role field 
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 400 with message "All fields are required"

WHEN a client sends registration request missing username field 
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 400 with message "All fields are required"

WHEN a client sends registration request missing password field 
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 400 with message "All fields are required"

WHEN a client sends registration request missing fullName field 
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 400 with message "All fields are required"

WHEN a client sends registration request with username that already exists 
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 400 with message "Username or Email already exists"

WHEN a client sends registration request with email that already exists 
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 400 with message "Username or Email already exists"

WHEN registration fails due to database constraint violation 
THE SYSTEM SHALL detect duplicate entry error and return appropriate user-friendly message

WHEN registration fails due to unexpected server error 
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 500 with message "Server error" and log the error details

Security Requirements:
THE SYSTEM SHALL hash all passwords using bcrypt with 10 rounds before storing in database 
THE SYSTEM SHALL never store passwords in plaintext anywhere in the system 
THE SYSTEM SHALL enforce unique constraints on both username and email fields 
THE SYSTEM SHALL log all registration errors with error details for debugging purposes 
THE SYSTEM SHALL validate role field against allowed values (admin, doctor, receptionist)
