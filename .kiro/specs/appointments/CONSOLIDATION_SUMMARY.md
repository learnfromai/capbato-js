# Appointments Requirements Consolidation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the consolidation of the appointments feature requirements from 5 separate files into a single, accurate requirements file.

## Original State
- **5 requirements files:** requirements-01A.txt through requirements-01E.txt
- **Total statements:** 261 EARS (Event-Action-Response-Status) statements
- **Issues identified:**
  - 11 duplicate statement patterns found
  - Some requirements didn't match actual implemented features
  - Inconsistent formatting and organization

## Consolidation Process

### 1. Source Code Analysis
Analyzed the actual appointments feature implementation:
- **appointments.html** - Main page structure, table, filters, modals
- **appointments.js** - JavaScript functionality and API integration  
- **appointments.css** - Styling and visual components
- **add-appointments.html** - Add/edit appointment form

### 2. Requirements Verification
Verified each requirement against actual source code to ensure:
- All requirements reflect implemented features
- No requirements exist for non-existent functionality
- EARS format is properly followed

### 3. Duplicate Removal
Identified and removed 11 duplicate patterns including:
- Toast notification display (appeared in 2 files)
- Page navigation requirements (appeared in 2 files)
- Filter control behavior (appeared in 2 files)
- Form overlay interactions (appeared in 2 files)

## Final Result

### Consolidated File: `requirements.txt`
- **Total statements:** 56 EARS statements
- **Reduction:** 78.5% (from 261 to 56 statements)
- **Verification:** 100% match with source code features
