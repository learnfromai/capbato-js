# Appointments Feature EARS Requirements

## Overview
This directory contains the consolidated EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) requirements for the appointments feature based on the actual implementation found in:
- `legacy/client/pages/appointments.html`
- `legacy/client/js/appointments.js`
- `legacy/client/assets/styles/appointments.css`

## Consolidation Process
The original 5 requirements files (requirements-01A.txt through requirements-01E.txt) contained significant duplication and some requirements that did not match the actual implementation. These have been consolidated into a single comprehensive requirements file.

## Files
- `requirements-consolidated.txt` - Complete EARS requirements based on actual implementation

## Requirements Categories
The consolidated requirements are organized into the following logical groups:

1. **Page Display and Navigation** - Basic page structure and navigation
2. **Authentication and Profile Management** - User authentication and profile features
3. **Date Filtering and Display Controls** - Date picker and "Show All" functionality
4. **Appointments Table Display** - Table structure and data formatting
5. **Add Appointment Functionality** - Overlay integration for adding appointments
6. **Appointment Status Management** - Cancel, Reconfirm, and Modify actions
7. **Appointment Status Updates** - API interactions for status changes
8. **User Feedback and Notifications** - Toast notifications and confirmation modals
9. **Data Loading and Error Handling** - API communication and error states
10. **State Management and Data Persistence** - Filter state and data synchronization

## Key Features Captured
- Date-based appointment filtering with "Show All" option
- Appointment capacity limit (4 confirmed appointments per time slot)
- Status management (Confirmed/Cancelled) with appropriate actions
- Profile avatar with username-based color generation
- Admin-specific features (Accounts menu injection)
- Toast notifications with 2-second auto-hide
- Proper case name formatting and 12-hour time display
- Error handling for API failures

## Requirements Removed
The following types of requirements were removed as they were either duplicated or not applicable to the appointments page:
- Form field validation (belongs to add-appointments form)
- Patient autocomplete functionality (not in main appointments page)
- Database connection specifics (too low-level)
- Phone number validation (not part of appointments display)
- Unimplemented settings functionality
