# Doctor Schedule EARS Requirements Consolidation

## Changes Made

This directory previously contained 5 duplicate EARS requirements files:
- requirements-01A.txt
- requirements-01B.txt  
- requirements-01C.txt
- requirements-01D.txt
- requirements-01E.txt

## Issues Identified

1. **Extensive Duplication**: All 5 files contained largely similar requirements with minor variations
2. **Inaccurate Requirements**: Some requirements did not match the actual implementation in the source code
3. **Non-existent Features**: Some files included requirements for features that don't exist in the codebase

## Solution Applied

1. **Analyzed Source Code**: Thoroughly reviewed the actual implementation:
   - `legacy/client/pages/doctor-schedule.html`
   - `legacy/client/js/doctor-schedule.js`
   - `legacy/client/assets/styles/doctor-schedule.css`
   - `legacy/client/pages/edit-sched.html`
   - `legacy/client/js/edit-sched.js`
   - Backend API endpoints and database schema

2. **Created Consolidated File**: Generated a single `requirements-01.txt` file that:
   - Contains only requirements that match the existing implementation
   - Eliminates all duplicates
   - Uses the source code as the single source of truth
   - Follows the same EARS format (WHEN...THE SYSTEM SHALL...)

3. **Backed Up Originals**: Original files are preserved in the `backup/` directory

## Final Structure

- `requirements-01.txt` - Single consolidated EARS requirements file
- `backup/` - Directory containing original 5 files for reference

## Verification

The consolidated requirements have been verified against the actual implementation to ensure:
- All requirements correspond to existing features
- API endpoints match actual backend implementation
- UI behaviors match the JavaScript implementation
- Database interactions align with the schema

The EARS now serve as an accurate checklist for the doctor-schedule feature migration.
